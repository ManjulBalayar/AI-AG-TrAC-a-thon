# AI-AG-TrAC-a-thon

Welcome to the repository for our Streamlit Rain Severity Prediction App, developed for an AI competition by me and my teammates focused on advancing agriculture. This app leverages a multi-class classification machine learning model to predict the severity of rain for the upcoming week, providing farmers and agricultural professionals with actionable insights to make informed decisions about their crops and farming activities.

## Features

- **Rain Severity Predictions**: Offers weekly rain severity forecasts, categorized into classes such as light, moderate, heavy, and extreme rainfall.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit, the app provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily interact with the prediction system.
- **Data Insights**: Visualize historical and predicted rainfall data through integrated charts and graphs, enhancing decision-making capabilities.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Helps in planning irrigation and water management more efficiently, potentially conserving water and reducing the impact on local water resources.
